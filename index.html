            <p>Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or simply Santa,
                is a legendary figure[1] originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts during the
                late evening and overnight hours on Christmas Eve. He is said to accomplish this with the aid of
                Christmas elves, who make the toys in his workshop, and with the aid of flying reindeer who pull his
                sleigh through the air</p>
            <p>The modern figure of Santa is based on folklore traditions surrounding Saint Nicholas, the English figure
                of Father Christmas, the German Belsnickel and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas.</p>
            <p>
                Santa is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often with spectacles, wearing a red
                coat with white fur collar and cuffs, white-fur-cuffed red trousers, a red hat trimmed with white fur, a
                black leather belt and boots, carrying a bag full of gifts for children. He is popularly associated with
                a deep, hearty laugh, frequently rendered in Christmas literature as "ho, ho, ho!"

            <p>This image originated in North America during the 19th century and has been maintained and reinforced
                through song, radio, television, children's books, family Christmas traditions, films, and advertising.
